# Matrix
This is a matrix class created for a class on computational methods. 
It includes implementations of Row Echelon Form reduction and back solving, 
LU Decomposition, Jacobi Iteration, Gauss-Seidel, Successive Over-Relaxation, and Power Iteration.

## Matrix.h
This file contains the declarations of the **Matrix** class methods.

## Matrix.cpp
This file contains the implementations of the class methods.

## Other cpp files
**main.cpp**, **domainDecomp.cpp**, **gaussSeidel.cpp**, **jacobi.cpp**, and **sor.cpp** were used
to read in data files, create matrices, and test specific Matrix methods for the class.
